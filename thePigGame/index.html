        This is a single two-Player dice game that you can play with your
        friend!
      </p>
      <p>
        Every turn, a player will repeatedly rolls a dice until the player decides to "End turn" or the player rolls a 1.
        <ul>
          <li>If 1 is rolled, the current score reset to 0 and it becomes the other player's turn.</li>
          <li>If another number is rolled, it is added to the player's current score and the player's turn continues.</li>
          <li>If the player "End turn", their current score is added to their total score and it becomes the turn of the other player.</li>
        </ul>
        The first player to score 100 or higher wins!
